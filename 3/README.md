The linear observations by medical professional of an insane person who is experiencing time in random order, every day they awake to a different time period and remember where they were last. Some days this person is a child, some days they are impossibly old.

A number of patients have died over the years, Detective Chuck Irons curiously reads the file about the crazy person and realizes the connection between what they've said over the years and the mysterious deaths he's investigating. He pursues the clues around the hospital and it all starts to fit together.

The killer is apprehended, the head of Psychiatry no less. That night, Detective Irons invites the insane man home to his family for dinner, to thank him. Starting with the children, then his wife and then moving onto him, the insane man kills them one by one.

Before he kills Chuck he tells him that he was the real killer, he gained a taste for killing when he began to understand the pattern of his time jumps and developed a personality. He just wanted to get out of that hospital for once before the end of the world tomorrow. He then stabs Chucks a few times and himself, they both die.
