A software engineer working on a global mapping system for the world's biggest tech company begins to question the ethics of his employer. He attempts to change the system from within but gets bullied and gaslit by those he trusts, causing him to lose his sense of self worth and turn to drugs and escapism.

One day at work, he's looking at the news and sees that aliens have been sighted and have begun bombing cities. He blinks for a second and the news is gone, he looks down and has a missed call on his phone from his mum and goes to take it outside, using it as a chance to have a few cigarettes as well.

He has an allergic reaction to a woman's perfume from the elevator and sneezes, for a brief second when he opens his eyes he sees the world in ruin around him with energy weapons raining from the sky. He blinks again and it's gone and he calls back but gets no answer.

Confused and unsure he goes home and gets a knock on his door before he has time to have a shower. A police officer informs him that his mother is dead, she'd died that day running through the streets screaming about an alien attack and got hit by a truck when she was on her phone.

He checks the news and confirms there was definitely no alien attack from space that day, aliens are still a myth. But his mother is definitely dead. He smokes a few cones and goes to sleep.
