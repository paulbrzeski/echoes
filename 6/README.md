A wealthy billionaire is researching immortality and funds the development of a radical mutagenic retrovirus that gives some test subjects extraordinary abilities. As a greedy man, he fails to look after his employees and has a constant turnover of staff.

Anonymous hackers infiltrate his computer systems and distribute the retrovirus formula freely, leading to the entire world developing different kinds of biological weapons in the form of powered humans.

An arms race begins as different countries race to develop the most powerful, interesting and unique abilities in the name of progressing their nation. Things escalate when the retrovirus enters the food chain from the deceased decomposing bodies, creating powered animals. 

The world is a more dangerous place now, Godzilla like reptiles roam the shores of Japan. Hope remains as the powered humans have answered the call and begun protecting and helping humanity as a whole.
