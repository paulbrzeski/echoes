Protagonist dreams of being in a fantastical magical land and affects that world by being in it several times. The size of the change and impact in the dreams affect the waking world and confuse the protagonist.

Slaying a troll in the dream and waking up to the workplace bully resigning the next day. One night, she dies in her dream and wakes up to the apocalypse in the real world as alien space craft fire weapons on the Earth from space.

She does a good job of surviving for a bit but succumbs to the chaos and dies. She wakes up at her desk realising she was daydreaming. The workplace bully is leaning over too close and being creepy, she ignores his gross advances, smiles gracefully and goes to lunch.
