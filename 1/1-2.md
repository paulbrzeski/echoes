In the few weeks that passed, Freeman and Nicholson fought few villains hoping to lay low.

Tonight, a rumour around town about a meeting of Pollution Illuminati generals was too good an opportunity so they headed out.

At the site of the meeting, Freeman and Nicholson stormed in cyber wands blazing only to find an empty room.

Worried, Nicholson teleports them first to his family home to check. Thankfully nothing had happened there.

Nicholson rotates his closed fist and moves them to Freeman's house. The place is completely trashed, it was a trap to capture his parents.

"Fuck, no. Mom and dad!" Morgan cried.
