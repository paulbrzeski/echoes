> Morgan Freeman is your average teenager, high schooler by day and vigilante wizard by night. Fighting the Pollution Illuminati is hard, but it's worth it to defeat the evil overlords of space and time.

"You can't defeat a god! I Sobekan will.." said the cocky crocodile headed man. He looked ridiculous dressed in head to toe Las Vegas style attire.

Minutes earlier, Morgan Freeman heard a scream behind Chess Pizza and came rushing into the dark alleyway to find this oddly overdressed villain holding a young girl by the hair.

"When I was a boy, my grandma made me alligator stew once." said Freeman, twirling his cyberwand behind his back.

Freeman's spell activates and freezes Sobekan's body, loosening his grip allowing the girl to break free and run away."

"You're welcome!" Freeman shouts back as he circles his wand hand forward while performing the mystical hand gesture with the cyberwand.

The helpless Sobekan looks on as Freeman gesticulates some arcane spell, he feels a brief amount of pressure all around him as he's blinked out of existence by the young teen wizard.

"Dude, did you kill Sobekan? The P.I. are mad. I'd lay low if I were you" said Jack Nicholson, Morgan's childhood friend, present day schoolmate and fellow vigilante wizard. He decided to check in on his friend and witnessed Sobekan's final moments.

"I know, I had no choice though. Not all of us can teleport villains straight to jail" Freeman replied.
