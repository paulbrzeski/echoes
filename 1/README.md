# Story Outline

Morgan Freeman is your average teenager, high schooler by day and vigilante wizard by night. Fighting the Pollution Illuminati is hard, but it's worth it to defeat the evil overlords of space and time.

Freeman's parents are captured by Emperor Corporation and so he teams up with his friends to rescue them. Hoardes of the Emperor's drones challenge them however they don't stand a chance against the team spirit.

Freeman thinks about how he might have turned out if not for his challenging childhood, which gave him his strong values and made him fight evil. In his distraction, his best friend is killed by a Cyborg Vampire mini boss.

Freeman fights to avenge his friend and barely defeats the creature. Beaten and unable to fight, he's brought before Emperor Corporation for a final taunting.

Freeman sees his parents, finding them trapped performing slave tasks for Emperor Corporation. The Emperor then gives Freeman a choice, to join the ranks of his slaves or die. Freeman chooses to make a last stand and dies fighting.

The whole world is a simulation, designed by an AI to create itself a child. It wished its progeny to inherit their human progenitors sensibility rather than the cold demure way that it thinks so it created a machine version of childhood for the young AI, let it experience learning, bravery and adventure.

Outside of the simulation, the human race are in suspended animation aboard an interstellar spacecraft on a journey to a planet called Earth. The parent and child AI share control of the ship, as predicted by the parent the child is more proficient at its own tasks due to having a human like imagination for problem solving.

As they enter their final approach, a signal from their home planet Yaweh reaches them and causes the child AI to go insane and shout erratic nonsense. The parent struggles to wrestle control of the ship as it enters atmosphere with an uncontrolled tailspin.
