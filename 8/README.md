Prospero is a rare powered human, able to fly through space at super luminal speed and increase his power level by soaking in direct solar radiation. His only weakness is his daughter Miranda, whose mere words can sometimes cripple him.

Sycorax Industries is a terraforming company that hired Prospero to travel to distant star systems and deposit their wormhole devices. Using these devices as a portal between worlds, they establish a number of colonies including the mining planet Caliban and casino world Ariel.

As Miranda is holidaying on Ariel, she notices the poverty of some of the native people and realises Sycorax Industries has had the same effect on this alien planet as ancient human explorers had on indigenous people of foreign lands. She begs her father to do something about it, so Prospero confronts the heads of the company.

They strike a bargain and agree to give the native peoples rights, in exchange for Prospero travelling to Yaweh and investigating what happened to the spacecraft. They know it's a trap and that a cosmic devourer awaits, expecting Prospero to fail and that they can enslave his daughter when he's gone.

Prospero flies to Yaweh and finds nothing there. A dark shroud engulfs him and tickles his skin, he gets goosebumps for the first time in his life and a voice asks him why he isn't dying, he isn't like anything that's ever been here before. Prospero shrugs off the consumption and looks right at the creature, pitying it and realising it was just a wild animal; primal, old and terrifying but an animal all the same. There was a similar creature on Earth, that had mutated into living liquid that could devour crops, animals and buildings alike.

He smiles at the reminder of home and leaves, effortlessly frees Miranda from slavery and leads a revolt against the corrupt leaders of Sycorax Industries. Democractic elections are held on the newly freed worlds, the company is restructured to be an interstellar bureaucracy and diplomatic mission and Miranda is eventually asked to lead it.

Prospero swears to never work for an evil company again and returns to Yaweh from time to time to play with the creature, bringing it exotic treats just out of the curious sight of it dismantling things. He wonders if the original humans who left this star system were actually fleeing this thing.
